My AWS Cloud Solutions Architect study notes

## Services

**Primary ones to focus on:  VPC, EC2, S3, EBS, ECS, LAMBDA, API, AutoScaling**

## EC2
+ Timeout isses => security groups configuration?  
+ Security groups can reference other security groups instead of ip ranges  
+ Public IP (obvious)  
+ elastic IP (same as public IP, but consistent IP between stop and starts)
+ Private IP (obvious)  
   
+ EC2 launch modes  
  + on demand  
  + reserved  
  + spot instances  
  + dedicated  
   
+ Instance types:  
  + R = Ram  
  + C = CPU  
  + M = Medium  
  + I = IO  
  + G = GPU  
  + T2/T3 = Burst (or budget)  

## Amazon Machine Image (AMI)  
+ Create AMI to pre-install software on for EC2 => faster boot/deployment of instances  
+ AMI can be copeid across regions and accounts.  (default within region only)  
  
* Instance placement groups  
+ Cluster - close together, high performance (faster network), less redundancy  
+ Spread - spread among multi-AZ's, more redundancy  

## CLB / ALB / NLB
+ CLB - may still have questions regarding security groups and stickiness  
  
+ ALB  
+ Support routing based on hostname (users.example.com & payments.example.com)  
+ Support routing based on path (example.com/users & example.com/payments)  
+ Support redirets (HTTP to HTTPS as example)  
+ Support dynamic host port mapping with ECS  

+ NLB (Layer 4) gets a static IP per AZ  
+ Public facing: must attach Elastic IP - can help whitelist by clients  
+ Private facing: will get random private IP base on free ones at time of creation  
+ Has cross zone balancing  
+ Has SSL termination (Jan 2019)  
  
*Restrict access to the EC2 instance by limiting security group source from the load balancer:*
![alt text](https://github.com/rlam13/AWS-Cloud-Solutions-Architect/blob/master/screenshots/load_balancer_security_groups.png)

+ SSL Certificates on load balancer  
+ The load balancer uses a X.509 certificate (SSL/TLS server certificate)  
+ Manage certificates using AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)  
+ Alternatively create/upload own certificates
  
HTTPS listener:  
Must specify default certificate  
Optional - add list of certs to support multiple domains
Clients can use Server Name Indication (SNI) to specify the hostname they reach  
Able to specify security policy to support older versions of SSL/TLS (for legacy clients)  

  
## ASG
ASG Default Termination Policy:  
1. Find AZ with most instances
2. If multiple instances in AZ, delete the one with oldest launch configuration  
  
* Scaling cooldown  
Ensures that ASG doesn't launch/terminate instances before previous scaling activity  
In addition to default cooldown -> create cooldowns that apply to specific scaling policy  
Default cooldown period is 300 seconds, can reduce down to reduce scale-in policy  
If multiple scale out/in during an hours, modifty ASG cool-down timer and CloudWatch alarm period that triggers scale in  

## EBS
Local storage, can only be attached to one instance at a time (like a USB stick)
Locked at the AZ level  
* if you need to attach to another AZ, then backup (snapshot) and recreate in another AZ  
EBS backups use IO, don't run while application is handling lots of traffic  
Root EBS volumes get terminated by default if EC2 instance is terminated (can be disabled, if needed)  
Increase EBS volume size if disk I/O is high

## EFS  
Network drive (file system) essentially
Can mount across lots of instances  
EFS share website files
EBS gp2, optimize cost

## Instance Store
The volume on the instance.  Ephemeral (higher performance, but not portable/flexible like EBS/EFS)
Custom AMI for faster deploy  
  
## RDS
Managed PostgreSQL/MySQL/Oracle/SQL Server
Need to provision EC2 instance & EBS Volume type and size
Relational DB  
Backups are enabled automatically  
  
DB Snapshots  
* manually triggered by user  
* reetention of backup as long as you need  
  
Read replicas can only SELECT (read-only), can't INSERT/DELETE/UPDATE  
Supports Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) for DB enryption  
* Oracle or SQL server DB instance only  
* TDE can be used on top of KMS - may affect performance  

  + Operations:
    + short downtime during failover, during maintenance, scaling in reads
      + EC2 or EBS restore implies manual intervention

  + Security:
    + IAM Authentication OR userid/password can be used  
    + Works for MySQL, PostgreSQL  
    + Lifespan of authentication token is 15 minutes (short-lived)  
    + Tokens are generated by AWS credentials   
    + SSL must be used when connecting to DB  
    + Easy to use EC2 Instance roles to connect to the RDS database  
    + Monitoring through CloudWatch
  
  + Reliability:
    + Multi AZ feature, failover in case of failure
    
  + Performance:
    + Depends on EC2 instance type, EBS volume type, ability to add read replicas.  Does not auto-scale
    
  + Cost:
    + Pay per hour for provisioned EC2 and EBS
    

  + Uses: RDBMS / OLTP, perform SQL queries, transaction inserts / update / delete is available
  
## Aurora
Proprietary from AWS  - Postgres and MySQL are supported with API  
Cloud optimzed 5x improvement over MySQL on RDS, and 3x of Postgres on RDS  
Grows in increments of 10GB, up to 64TB  
Up to 15 replicas.  (MySQL can have 5), faster replication <10ms replica lag
  + can be global read replica
Failover in Aurora is instantaneous - HA native  
Costs ~20% more - but more efficient  
Auto healing capability
Auto fail-over  
Backup & Recovery  
Isolation & security  
Industry Compliance  
Push-button scaling  
Automated patching w/ zero downtime  
Advanced monitoring  
Routine maintenance  
Backtrack: restore data at any point with using backups  
No SSH (managed service)  
No need to choose instance size / helpful with unknown workload / DB scales automatically based on CPU & connections  
Can migrate from Aurora Cluster to Aurora Serverless and vice versa  
  
Aurora Serverless usage measured in Aurora Capacity Units (ACU), billed in 5 minute increment of ACU  
  
IAM Authentication for MySQL and PostgreSQL  
Aurora Global DB span multipl regions and enable DR  
* one primary region  
* one DR region  
* DR region can be used for lower latency reads  
* < 1 second replica lag on average  
If not use Global DB, can create cross-region read replics  
* FAQ recommends Global DB  

Use: same as RDS, but less maintenance, more flexibility, more performance

* Operations:
  + less operations, auto scaling storage
* Security:
  + AWS responsible for OS security, owner responsible for setting up KMS, security groups, IAM policies, authorizing users in DB use SSL
* Reliability:
  + Multi AZ, highly available, possibly more than RDS, serverless option available
* Performance:
  + 5x performance (according to AWS) due to artchitectural optimizations.  Up to 15 Read Replicas (only five for RDS)
* Cost:
  + Pay per hour based on EC2 and storage usage.  Possibly lower costs compared to Enterprise grade databases such as Oracle
  
  
## Elasticache
Manaaged Redis or Memcached  (similar to RDS, but for cache)
Very high performance, sub-milisecond latency  
Must provision an EC2 instance type
Support for Clustering (Redis) and Multi AZ, Read Replicas (sharding)
Write scaling using sharding  
Read scaling useing read replicas  
Multi AZ with failover capability  
AWS managed. (OS maintenance/patching,optimizations,setup,config,monitoring, failure recovery and backups)  
SASL authentication (no IAM)  

Use Case: Key/Value store, Frequent reads, less writes, cache results for DB queries, store session data for websites, cannot use SQL.

Operations:
  + same as RDS
* Security:
  + AWS responsible for OS security, owner responsible for setting up KMS, security groups, IAM policies, users (Redis Auth), use SSL
* Reliability:
  + Clustering, Multi AZ
* Performance:
  + sub-milisecond performance, in memory, read replicas for sharding, very popular cache option
* Cost:
  + Pay per hour based on EC2 and storage usage.

## Redis
RedisAUTH (username/password) (no IAM)  
SSL in-flight encryption must be enabled and used  
  
## Route 53
Most common recoto know:  
* A: URL to IPv4
* AAAA: URL to IPv6
* CNAME: URL to URL
* Alias: URL to AWS resource
    
TTL (Time to Live)  
High TTL (24hr)  
* Less traffic on DNS
* Possibly outdated records  
  
Low TTL (60s)
* more traffic on DNS  
* records are outdated for less time
* easy to change records
  
TTL is mandatory for each DNS record  
  
* AWS Resources (load balancers, cloudfront, etc) expose AWS URL:  
lbl-us-west-1.elb.amazonaws.com but you want it to appear as mycoolapp.cooldomain.com  
  
* CNAME:  
Points URL to another URL (mycoolapp.cooldomain.com >> somethingelse.com)  
Works only for NON ROOT DOMAIN ( mycoolapp.cooldomain.com)
  
* Alias:
Points a URL to AWS resource (mycoolapp.cooldomain.com >> somethingelse.amazonaws.com)
Works for ROOT DOMAIN and NON ROOT DOMAIN.  (aka cooldomain.com)
  
* Simple Routing Policy  
Maps a domain to one URL  
Used to redirect single resource  
Cannot attach health checks to Simple Routing Policy  
If multiple values are returned, random one chosen by client  
  
* Weighted Routing Policy  
Route traffic to multiple resources in proportions you specify
Helpful to test percentage of traffic on a new app version, if needed  
Can split traffic between two regions  
Can be associated with health checks  
  
* Latency Routing Policy
Redirect to the server that has the least latency  
Latency determined by user to designated AWS Region
  - Germany could be directed to the US, if that's the lower latency  

* Health Checks  
Have X health checks failed - unhealthy (default 3)  
After X health checks passed - healthy (default 3)  
Default health check interval: 30s (can set to 10s - costs more)  
Approximately 15 health checkers will check the endpoint health  
Can use HTTP/TCP and HTTPS health checks (no SSL verification)  
Possibility of integrating health check with CloudWatch 
  
Health checks can be linked to Route53 DNS queries  
  
* Failover Routing Policy  
For active/passive failover  
  
* Geo Location Routing Policy  
Routing based on user location (different from latency based)  
  
* Multivalue Answer Routing Policy  
Deploy when you want Route 53 to respond to DNS queries with up to eight healthy records selected at random 
  
* Route 53 can be a Registar  
Domain registar is an organization that manages reservation of Internet domain names

* Third Party Registrar with Route 53  
Route 53 can be used if domain is bought from third party website
  - Create hosted zone in Route 53
  - Update NS records on third party website to use Route 53 name servers  
  
## S3
Objects(files) have a key.  The key is the full path:
<example_bucket_name>/example.txt  
<example_bucket_name>/sample_folder/another_folder/example.txt  
No actual directories - the UI will make it look like directories  
Object values are the content of the body:
  + max size 5TB
  + if upload is larger than 5GB, must use multi-part upload  
Metatdata (list of text key / value pairs - system or user metadata)  
Tags (unicode key/value pair - up to ten) - useful for security / lifecycle
Versioning can be enabled at the bucket level
  + same key overwrite will increment the version. IE: 1, 2, 3 etc....  
  + best practice to version buckets  
  
Files not versioned prior to enabling versioning will have version "null"  
  
* Encryption for Objects  
  + SSE-S3: AWS handles and manages keys  
    + Object is encrypted server side
    + AWS-256 encryption type
    + Must set header: "x-amz-server-side-encryption":"AES256"
  + SSE-KMS: AWS Key Management Service to manage encryption keys  
    + KMS Advantages: user control + audit trail
    + Object is encrypted server side
    + Must set header: "x-amz-server-side-encryption":"aws:kms"
  + SSE-C: self manage encryption keys  
    + Server-side encryption using data keys fully managed by the customer side
    + S3 doesn't store the encryption key
    + HTTPS must be used
    + Encryption key must provided in HTTP headers, for every HTTP request made
  + Client side encryption is an option  
    + Client library such as Amazon S3 Encryption Client
    + Client must encrypt data before sending to S3
    + Client must decrypt data after retrieving from S3
    + Encryption cycle fully managed by customer  
  
* Security
  + User based - IAM policies 
    + Set which API calls are permitted by specific user via IAM console
  + Resource based  
    + Bucket Policies - bucket wide rules from the S3 console - allows cross account
    + Object Access Control List (ACL) - finer granularity
    + Bucket Access Control List (ACL) - not as common  
    
* Bucket Policies
  + JSON based 
    + Resources buckets and objects
    + Actions: Set of API to Allow or Deny
    + Effect: Allow / Deny
    + Principal: The account or user to apply the policy to
  + Use S3 bucket for policy to:
    + Grant public access to the bucket
    + Force objects to be encrypted at upload
    + Grant access to another account (cross account)  
  
* Other
  + Networking:
    + Supports VPC Endpoints (for instance in VPC without www internet)
  + Logging and Audit
    + S3 access logs can be stored in other S3 bucket
    + API calls can be logged in AWS CloudTrail
  + User Security:
    + MFA can be required in versioned buckets to delete objects
    + Signed URL's: URL's that are valid only for a limited time (IE: premium video service for logged in users)
    
* Websites
  + S3 can host static websites 
  + The website URL would be:
    + <bucket_name>.s3-website-<AWS-region>.amazonaws.com
              OR
    + <bucket_name>.s3-website.<AWS-region>.amazonaws.com
  + If 403 error, confirm bucket policy allows public read
   
* As Database
  + Key / value store for objects
  + Great for big objects, not as good for small objects
  + Serverless, scales infinitely, max object size is 5TB
  + Eventually consistency for overwrites and deletes
  + Tiers: S3 Standard, S3 IA, S3 One Zone IA, Glacier for backups
  + Features: versioning, encryption, cross regions replication
  + Security: IAM, bucket policies, ACL
  + Encryption: SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, SSE-C, client side encryption, SSL in transit
  + Uses: static files, key value store for big files, webiste hosting
  
* Operations:
  + no operations needed
* Security:
  + IAM, Bucket Policies, ACL, Encryption (server/client), SSL
* Reliability:
  + 99.999999999% durability, 99.99% availability, Multi AZ, CRR
* Performance:
  + scales to thousands of reads / writes per second, transfer acceleration / multi-part for big files
* Cost:
  + pay per storage usage, network cost, request number
   
* Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
  + limits the number of webiste that request your files in S3 (saves money)
  
* Consistency Model
  + Read after write consistency for PUTS of new objects
    + as soon as object is written we can retrieve it (PUT 200 -> GET 200)
    + except if GET was done before (GET 404 -> PUT 200 -> GET 404) -eventually consistent
  + Eventual consistency for DELETES and PUTS of existing objects
    + If read object after updating, may get the older version (PUT 200 -> PUT 200 -> GET 200)
    + If delete object, may be able to retrieve it for a short time after (DELETE 200 -> GET 200)
    
* MFA Delete
    + Require MFA to permanently delete object version
    + Require MFA to suspend versioning on the bucket
    + MFA not required for enabling version
    + MFA not required for listing deleted versions
    + Only the bucket owner (root account) can enable/disable MFA delete
    + MFA delete currently enabled using the CLI

* Default Encryption vs Bucket Policies
    + old way: use bucket policy and refuse HTTP command without proper headers
    + new way: default encryption in S3 (bucket policies are evaulated before "default encryption"
  
* Access logs
    + optional: log all access to S3 buckets
    + optional: use Athena to analyze directly from a bucket
  
* Cross Region Replication
    + must enable versioing (source & destination)
    + buckets must be in different AWS regions
    + can be in different accounts
    + copying is asynchronous
    + must give proper IAM permissions to S3
    + use cases: compliance, lower latency access, replication across accounts
    
* Presigned URLs
  + Grant temporary access to users with pre-signed URL to have them inherit permissions of person that generated the URL (GET/PUT)
  + Default 3600 secs
  + Downloads (easy, can use the CLI)
  + Uploads (harder, must use the SDK)
  + Applications:  
    + allow only logged in users to download premium video on S3 bucket
    + allow ever changing list of users to download files by generating URL's dynamically
    + allow temporarily a user to upload a file to a precise location within a bucket
  
* CloudFront, aka Content Delivery Network (CDN)
  + improved read performance, content cached at edge locations, 136 points of presence globally
  + popular with S3, but works with EC2 and load balancing
  + can help against network attacks
  + can provide SSL encryption (HTTPS) at edge using ACM
  + Cloudfront can use HTTPS to communicate with your applications
  + supports RTMP Protocol (video/media)
  
* Cloudfront vs S3 Cross Region Replication  
  + Cloudfront
    + Global edge network
    + Files are cached for a TTL (approximately a day)
    + Perfect for static content that must be available everywhere
  + S3 Cross Region Replication
    + Required to be setup for each region where replication are needed
    + Files are updated in near real-time
    + Read only
    + Perfect for dynamic content that requires low-latency availability in few regions
  
* S3 Standard  
  + High durability 99.99999999999% across multiple AZ
  + 99.99% availability over a given year
  + Can sustain two concurrent facility failurs
  + Uses: Big data analytics, mobile & gaming applicatoins, content distribution
  
* S3 Standard - Infrequent Access (IA)
  + For data less frequently accessed, but requires rapid access
  + High durability 99.99999999999% across multiple AZ
  + 99.99% availability over a given year
  + Can sustain two concurrent facility failures
  + Uses: data store for disaster recovery and backups
  
* S3 One Zone - Infrequent Access (IA)
  + Same as IA but data in a single AZ
  + High durability 99.99999999999% in one AZ
  + 99.95% availability over a given year
  + Low cost compared to IA (20% cheaper)
  + Uses: secondary backup copies of on-premise data or storing data that can be recreated easily
  
* S3 Glacier
  + Low cost object storage for archiving
  + Meant for longer term storage
  + Alternative to on-premise magnetic tape
  + High durability 99.99999999999%
  + Cost per storage per month ($0.004/ GB) + retrieval cost
  + Each item in Glacier is called "Archive" (up to 40TB)
  + Archives are stored in "Vaults"
  + Retrieval options:
    + Expedited (1 to 5 minutes retrieval) - $0.03 per GB and $0.01 per request
    + Standard (3 to 5 hours retrieval) - $0.01 per GB and $0.05 per 1000 request
    + Bulk (5 to 12 hours retrieval) - $0.0025 per GB and $0.025 per 1000 request
    
* S3 Lifecycle Rules
  + Rules to trigger when to move data to lower tiers to save storage cost
  + IE: General Purpose > IA > Glacier
  + Transition actions: Defines when objects transition to another storage class
  + Expiration actions: Assists in configuring object to expire after certain period
  
* Snowball
  + Physical transport, secure, tamper resistant, KMS 256, tracking
  + If it takes more than a week to transfer over the network, use Snowball
  
* Snowball Edge
  + Same as Snowball but adds computational capability.

## SQS
  + Fully managed
  + Scales from one message/second to 10k messages/second
  + Default retention of messsage: four days, maxiumum 14 days
  + no limit of messages in the queue
  + low latency (<10ms on publish and receive)
  + horizontal scaling in terms of number of consumers
  + can have duplicate messages (at least once delivery, occasionally)
  + can have out of order messages
  + limitation of 256kb per message
    + Delay Queue
      + Delay a message up to 15 minutes
      + Default is 0 seconds (message available right away)
      + Set default at queue level
      + Can override the default using the DelaySeconds parameter
    + Visibility Timeout
      + when consumer polls a message from a queue, the message is "invisible" to other consumers for a defined period
        + set between 0 seconds and 12 hours (default 30 secs)
        + If too high, 15 minutes and consumer fails to process the message, wait a long time before processing the message again
        + If too low, 30 seconds and consumer needs time to process the message (two minutes), another consumer will receive the message will be processed more than once
      + ChangeMessageVisiblity API to change the visbility while processing a message
      + DeleteMessage API to tell SQS the message was successfully processed
    + Dead Letter Queue
      + If consumer fails to process a message within the Visibility Timeout --> message goes back to the queue
      + Can set threshold of how many times message(s) go back to queue (aka redrive policy)
        + After threshold exceeded messages goes to dead letter queue (DLQ)
        + Need to create a DLQ first then designate it as DLQ
        + Ensure to process messages in DLQ before they expire
        
![alt text](https://github.com/rlam13/AWS-Cloud-Solutions-Architect/blob/master/screenshots/SQS.png)
      
    + FIFO Queue
      + First In / First Out (not available in all regions)
      + Name of queue must end in .fifo
      + lower throughput (3,000/s with batching, 300/s w/o)
      + Messages processed in order by the consumer
      + Messages are sent exactly once
      + No per message delay (only per queue delay)
      + Ability for conten base de-duplication
      + Five minute interval de-duplication using "Duplication ID"
      + Message groups:
        + Can group messages for FIFO using "Message GroupID"
        + Only one workder assigned per message group so messages are prcessed in order
        + Message group is just and extra tag on the message
        
## SNS
  + Event producer only sends message to one SNS topic
  + Event receivers (subscriptions) want to listen to the SNS topic notificaions
  + Each subscirber to topic will get all messages (note: new feature to filter messages)
  + Up to 10,000,000 subscriptions per topic / 100,000 topics limit
  + Subcribers can be:
    + SQS, HTTP / HTTPS (with deilvery retries - how many times), Lambda, Emails, SMS messages, Mobile Notifications

## AWS Shared Responsibility Model

### AWS Responsibility - Security of the Cloud
  + Protecting infrastructure (hardware,software,facilities, and networking) that runs all of the AWS services)
  + Managed services like S3, DynamoDB, RDS etc
  
### Customer Responsibility - Security in the Cloud
  + For EC2 instance, customer is responsible for management of the guest OS (including security patches and updates), firewall & network configuration, IAM etc

### RDS Example
  + AWS Resposibility:
    + Manage the underlying EC2 instance, disable SSH
    + Automated DB patching
    + Automated OS patching
    + Audit underlying instance and disks & guarantee it funtions
  + Customer Responsiblity:
    + Check the ports / IP / security group inbound rules in DB's SG
    + In-database user creation and permissions
    + Creating a database with or without public access
    + Ensure parameter groups or DB is configured to only allow SSL connections
    + Database encryption setting
    
### S3 Example
  + AWS Responsibility
    + Guarantee unlimited storage
    + Guarantee encryption is available
    + ensure separation of data between different customers
    + ensure AWS employees can't access your data
  + Customer Responsibility
    + Bucket configuration
    + Bucket policy / public setting
    + IAM user and roles
    + Enabling encryption

## VPC

### CIDR
+ /32 allows for 1 IP's = 2^0
+ /31 allows for 2 IP's = 2^1
+ /30 allows for 4 IP's = 2^2
+ /29 allows for 8 IP's = 2^3
+ /28 allows for 16 IP's = 2^4
+ /27 allows for 32 IP's = 2^5
+ /26 allows for 64 IP's = 2^6
+ /25 allows for 128 IP's = 2^7
+ /24 allows for 256 IP's = 2^8
+ /16 allows for 65,536 IP's = 2^16
+ /0 allows for all IP's = 2^32

### Private IP
+ 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 (10.0.0.0/8) <-- big networks
+ 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 (172.16.0.0./12) <-- default AWS
+ 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 (192.168.0.0/16) <-- Typical in home networks

### Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
+ multiple VPC's per region ( max 5 per region, soft limit, increase via support ticket)
+ max CIDR per VPC is five. Each CIDR:
  + min size /28 = 16 IP addresses
  + max size /16 = 65536 IP addresses
+ because VPC is private, only the private IP ranges are allowed (see Prive IP section above)
+ **VPC CIDR should not overlap with other networks IE: corporate**

### Subnets - IPv4
+ Tied to an AZ / need to define a CIDR
+ AWS reserves five IP's address (first four, and last IP address) in each subnet
  + none of these are available for use and cannot be assigned to an instance
+ IE: CIDR block 10.0.0.0/24, reserved IP's are:
  + 10.0.0.0: network address
  + 10.0.0.1: reserved by AWS for the VPC router
  + 10.0.0.2: reserved by AWS for mapping to Amazon provided DNS
  + 10.0.0.3: reserved by AWS for future use
  + 10.0.0.255: network broadcast address.  AWS doesn't support broadcast in a VPC, but address is still reserved
  
### Internet Gateway
+ Internet gateways allow VPC instances to conect to the internet
+ Scales horizontally and is HA / redundant
+ Created separately from VPC
+ one VPC can be attached to one IGW and vice versa
+ IGW also a NAT for instances that have public IPv4
+ IGW by itself does not allow internet access, route tables must also be edited

#### NAT Instance
+ Allow instances in the private subnets to connect to the internet
+ must be launched in a public subnet
+ must be disable EC2 flag: source / destination check
+ must have elastic IP attached to it
+ route table must be configured to route traffic from private subnets to NAT instance
+ Amazon Linux AMI pre-configured are available
+ Not highly available / resilient setup out of the box
+ Would need to create ASG in multi AZ + resilient user-data script
+ Internet traffic bandwidth depends on EC2 instance performance
+ Must manage security groups & rules
  + Inbound:
    + allow HTTP / HTTPS traffic coming from private subnets
    + allow SSH from your home network (access provided through IGW)
  + Outbound:
    + allow HTTP / HTTPS traffic to the internet

#### NAT Gateway
+ AWS managed NAT, higher bandwidth, better availability, no admin
+ Pay by the hour for usage and bandwidth
+ NAT is created in a specific AZ, uses an Elastic IP
+ Cannot be used by and instance in that subnet (only from other subnets)
+ Requires and IGW (Private Subnet => NAT => IGW)
+ 5Gbps of bandwidth with automatic scaling up to 45Gbps
+ No security group to manage / required


#### DNS Resolution in VPC
+ enableDnsSupport: (DNS Resolution setting)
  + Default True
  + Helps decide if DNS resolution is support for the VPC
  + If true, queries the AWS DNS server at 169.254.169.253
+ enableDnsHostname: (DNS Hostname setting)
  + False by default for newly created VPC, True by default for Default VPC
  + Won't do anything unless enableDnsSupport = True
  + If true, assign public hostname to EC2 instance if it has a public

*If you use custom DNS domain names in a private zone in Route 53, you must set both attributes to true

#### Network ACLs (NACL)
+ NACL is like a firewall, but applies to traffic for subnets
+ Default NACL allows everything inbound and outbound
+ One NACL per subnet, new subnets are assigned default NACL
+ Define NACL rules:
  + Rules have a number (1-32766) and higher precedence with a lower number
  + Eg If you define #100 ALLOW <IP> and #200 DENY <IP>, IP will be allowed
  + Last rule is an asterisk (*) and denies a request in case of no rule match
  + AWS recommends adding rules by increment of 100
+ Newly created NACL will deny everything
+ Do not forget to include ephemeral ports
  
#### Security Group vs NACL

| Security Group                        |         NACL                         |
| --------                              |      ----------                      |
| Operates at instance level            |   Operates at the subnet level       |
| Supports allows rules only            |   Supports allow and deny rules      |
| Stateful: return traffic is automatically allowed regardless of rules | Stateless: Return traffic must be explicity allowed by rules |
| Evaluate all rules before determining to allow traffic | Process rules in number order when determining to allow traffic |
| Applies to instance if applied the security group at launch time or associates group with the instance later | Automatically applies to all instances within the subnet (Don't have to rely on users to specify the security group) |

#### VPC Peering
+ Connect two VPC's privately using AWS' network  (make them behave as same network)
+ Must not  have overlapping CIDR
+ Peering connection is not transitive.  (must be established for each VPC that needs to communicate with one each)

#### Flow logs
+ Captures information about IP traffic going into your interfaces:
  + VPC flow logs
  + Subnet flow logs
  + Elastic network interface flow logs
+ Helps to monitor & troubleshoot connectivity issues
+ Flow logs data can go to S3 / CloudWatch logs
+ Captures network information from AWS managed interfaces too: ELB, RDS, ElastiCache, Redshift, WorkSpaces

+ Syntax:
  + <version> <account-id> <interface-id> <srcaddr> <dstaddr> <srcport> <dstport> <protocol> <packets> <bytes> <start> <end> <action> <log-status>
+ sraaddr, dstaddrs help identify problematic IP
+ srcport, dstport help identify poblematic ports
+ action: success or failure of the request due to security group / nacl
+ can be used for analytics on usage patterns or malicious behaviour

#### Bastion Hosts
+ Use bastion host to SSH into ou private instances
+ Bastion hosts are connected to the public subnet which is then connected to all other private subnets
+ Bastion host security group must be tightened
  + ensure the bastion host only has port 22 traffic from the IP(s) required

#### Site to Site VPN
+ Virtual Private Gateway:
  + VPN concentrator on the AWS side of the VPN connection
  + VPGW is created and attached to the VPC from which you want to create the site to site VPN connection

+ Customer Gateway
  + Software application or physical device on customer side of the VPN connection
  + IP address:
    + use static, internet-routable IP address for your customer gateway device
    + If behind a CGW behind NAT (with NAT-T), use the public IP address of the NAT

#### Direct Connect
+ Dedicated private connection from remote network to a VPC
+ Must be setup between DC and AWS Direct Connect locations
+ REquires a VPGW on VPC
+ Access public resources (S3) and private (EC2) on the same connection
+ Uses:
  + Increase bandwidth throughput - work with large data sets - lower cost
  + More consistent network experience - applications using real-time data feeds
  + Hybrid environments (on-prem + cloud)
+ Supports IPv4 & IPv6

#### Egress only Internet Gateway
+ Egress only Internet Gateway for IPv6 only
+ Similar function as a NAT (IPv4 only)
+ IPv6 are all public addresses
+ All instances with IPv6 are publicy accessible
+ Egress only Internet Gateway allows IPv6 instances access to the internet, but will not be directly reachable by the internet
+ Edit route tables after creating Egress only Internet Gateway
